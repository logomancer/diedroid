## DieDroid, an Android application for rolling dice

This is an Android application for a dice roller suitable for many different purposes, but was designed as a tool for pen-and-paper RPGs. Includes a general dice roller, a dice pool roller that counts successes, and an ability score roller to roll stats for characters.
